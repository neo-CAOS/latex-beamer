# Project Report

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for the project report associated with
[Project Repository](https://github.com/neo-CAOS/), which holds the main code and related materials.
The report repository will be included as a submodule in the main project repository to facilitate
a seamless integration of documentation alongside the project.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `sections/`: contains separate LaTeX files for each section of the report.
- `images/`: stores all images and diagrams included in the report.
- `main.tex`: the main LaTeX file that compiles the entire report.
- `compile.sh`: a script to compile the report.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile the report or clean the output directory, you can use the provided `compile.sh` script.

### First Time Setup

Before using the `compile.sh` script for the first time, make sure it has the necessary execute permissions. Run the following command to grant execute permissions to the script:

```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
```

### Compile the Report

Run the following command to compile the report:

```bash
./compile.sh
```

This command will generate the final PDF document from the LaTeX source files and store it in the `out` directory. Ensure all dependencies, including LaTeX and bibliography tools, are installed on your system before running the command.

### Clean the Output Directory

To remove all files from the output directory (`out`), you can use the `clean` option:

```bash
./compile.sh clean
```

This command deletes all files in the output directory if it exists, ensuring a fresh build environment for the next compilation.

For any issues, please refer to the main project repository or contact the authors.

This repository is structured for ease of integration and version control, with the report versioned separately from the main codebase. Happy compiling!
